# About Me

Hi, I'm Joya, a Commerce/Information Systems student at UNSW. I am aspiring to become a product and UI designer and my interest in Front-End Development helped me to make this portfolio using ReactJS. 

# Resources

I used [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) as a base for the portfolio and the icons are from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
